# ⚡️ Welcome to my (code) chamber of secrets

I'm **Ángeles Martín**, Android & Multiplatform Developer with a magical touch.

Once a humble apprentice in the arcane arts of Android development, I now stand as a seasoned sorceress with nearly five years conjuring spells through **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**. Over the past year, I’ve ventured into the enchanted realm of **Kotlin Multiplatform** and **Compose Multiplatform**, crafting incantations that work across realms (Android and beyond).

Though I have yet to wield my wand in iOS UI enchantments, I’ve studied the scrolls of its build rituals and am ever-ready to join forces with fellow iOS conjurers. My quest? To uphold the sacred traditions of clean architecture, composable spells, and platform harmony as I grow deeper into the mystical forest of KMM.

Forged over years of study in the School of Craft & Code, this toolkit contains the essential instruments I wield in my daily magical code practice.
